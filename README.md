# DevOps-Infra-Setup 🚀

Frustrated with the complexity of setting up DevOps tools? Meet DevOps-Infra-Setup—a revolutionary script designed to automate and simplify the entire process. It streamlines the installation and configuration of critical DevOps infrastructure, letting you save time and focus on what truly matters.

Want to see how this script can transform your DevOps workflow? Dive in to discover its game-changing benefits! 

## 🎯 Features

- **Automated Setup Scripts**:
  - **Default Setup**: Installs Java, AWS CLI, Docker, Terraform, and Ansible.
  - **Jenkins Setup**: Installs and configures Jenkins only.
  - **Full CI/CD Environment**: Installs Jenkins, SonarQube, Trivy, and Nexus.
  - **Kubernetes Environment**: Sets up `kubectl`, Helm, and `eksctl` for managing Kubernetes clusters.
    
  
## 🔒 Security Note

- **Bypassed Jenkins!**: 

    Want to skip the usual Jenkins setup headaches? Our script bypasses the default admin password configuration, allowing you to get started right away. Here are the default credentials:

  - **Username**: `admin`
  - **Password**: `admin`

    Driven by curiosity, I just reverse-engineered and successfully bypassed the Jenkins initial admin password setup😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
